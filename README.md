# Work-Scheduler
## Description

The work-scheduler is tailored to the average 9AM - 5AM employee that needs an extra touch of organization. The simple UI allows for a a user to input notes, tasks, or reminders for a certain time throughout an average workday. As an added feature, the planner also shows if a certain task has gone past the time it was set for.

## What Problem Did This Challenge Solve?

The problem this project tackles is using the jquery library as well as dayJS. Understanding how to properly implement Javascript code from a third party API creates a learning curve new to budding developers as it deviates from the normal syntax of vanilla Javascript.

## What Was Learned?

This project helps teach developers unfamiliar with third party APIs and the proper syntax required to use them. It also delves into the dayJS framework and how to utilize it for features such as time and date.
